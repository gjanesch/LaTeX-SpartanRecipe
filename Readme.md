## Summary
This is a short, very basic .sty file which generates a handful of simple environments and commands that help to write clean, basic recipes in LaTeX.

Included is a sample .tex file using these environments, along with the corresponding PDF output.

Requires installation of the cookingsymbols package.  Several other standard packages (tikz, bold-extra, ifsym, array, url, multicol) are used as well.
